## What is nachos?
Nachos is an app that places an image of Nachos in front of your screen.
The idea is that the nachos looks very good and you enjoy watching it.
You better enjoy watching it anyway, cuz there's no way to get rid of it!

## How to get rid of it???
Nachos is not designed to be able to get rid of. If you do want to get rid of it, however, we have implemented a few methods.
1. **End the task**
   *to end the task, you can open task manager and end the task.*
2. **Restart your computer**
   *Restarting your computer ends all running tasks, including Nachos.*
3. **Click 4000 times**
   *If the above methods fail, you can, as a last resort, click 4000 times on the image of Nachos. This will likely take a really long time.*
Once completing one of the above methods, you can run uninstall.exe in C:\Program Files (x86)\Nachos\ or whatever folder you downloaded it into, to permanently remove nachos.
