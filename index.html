<h2>What is Nachos?</h2>
<p>Nachos is an app that places an image of Nachos in front of your screen. <br>The idea is that the nachos looks very good and you enjoy watching it. <br>You better enjoy watching it anyway, cuz there's no way to get rid of it!</p>
<h2>How to get rid of it???</h2>
<p>
  Nachos is not designed to be able to get rid of. If you do want to get rid of it, however, we have implemented a few methods.<br>
1. <b>End the task.</b> <br>
  <i>to end the task, you can open task manager and end the task.</i><br>
2. <b>Restart your computer.</b><br> 
  <i>Restarting your computer ends all running tasks, including Nachos.</i><br>
3. <b>Click 4000 times.</b> <br>
  <i>If the above methods fail, you can, as a last resort, click 4000 times on the image of Nachos. This will likely take a really long time.</i><br>
Once completing one of the above methods, you can run uninstall.exe in C:\Program Files (x86)\Nachos\ or whatever folder you downloaded it into, to permanently remove nachos.
